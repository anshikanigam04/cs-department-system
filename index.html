                <h2>Cirriculum</h2>
                <p>With the technological advancement and rapid growth in MNCs and IT, the need for computer
                    professionals is growing day-by-day. Hence, BCA is an excellent career choice for those who have
                    always been fascinated by the world of the computer.

                    Bachelor of Computer Applications is a three-year undergraduate course which deals with information
                    technology and computer applications. The course imparts knowledge about different computer
                    applications and how to solve and address the problems which arise from a computer and its
                    applications. The course includes subjects such as core programming languages Java and C++, data
                    structure, networking and others. BCA provides various opportunities to the students who wish to
                    pursue their career in IT and software.

                    The course is divided into six semesters and because of its popularity, it is available both as a
                    regular degree and distance learning. Candidates can choose as per their interests and capabilities.

                <h2>Cirriculum</h2>
                <p>Computers became popular after the 1980s when they were made available for public use. There is
                    hardly any sector left which is not dependent on computers or somehow does not involve the use of
                    computers. Rampant growth of computers has led to the demand for professionals who can operate and
                    make use of computers to increase productivity and pave the way for innovation in businesses.
                    Universities and colleges are dedicated to offering computer courses and a large number of students
                    opt for degrees in Computer Science and Applications worldwide. If you are a graduate planning to go
                    for a PhD after MCA, then you are the right place to understand every detail associated with your
                    choice.</p>
